# Tasks: Implement Maze Generation

**Version**: 2.0
**Status**: Ready
**Author**: Gemini
**Created**: 2025-11-02

**Feature Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Implementation Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## 1. Overview

This document provides a detailed, actionable list of tasks to implement the maze generation feature. The tasks are derived from the feature's specification, plan, data model, and contracts. They are organized into logical phases to ensure a structured and efficient implementation process.

## 2. Phase 1: Setup & Foundational Tasks

There are no specific setup or foundational tasks required for this feature, as it builds upon the existing project structure. All implementation will occur within the existing `MazeService`.

## 3. Phase 2: Core Implementation (User Story 1)

This phase covers all functional requirements for generating and managing the maze lifecycle.

**User Story Goal**: As a player, when I start a game, I want to be teleported into a fully generated, physical maze structure so that I can begin navigating and solving it.

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- A maze model can be successfully generated by calling `MazeService.generate("Medium")`.
- The generated model contains multiple `Part` instances for walls and a floor.
- The generated model can be successfully removed from the workspace by calling `MazeService.destroy(model)`.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T001 [US1] Implement the internal grid data structure initialization in `src/ServerScriptService/Services/MazeService.lua`
- [x] T002 [US1] Implement the Recursive Backtracker algorithm for path carving in `src/ServerScriptService/Services/MazeService.lua`
- [x] T003 [US1] Implement the physical construction of walls and floor from the grid data in `src/ServerScriptService/Services/MazeService.lua`
- [x] T004 [US1] Integrate the generation steps into the public `MazeService.generate` function in `src/ServerScriptService/Services/MazeService.lua`
- [x] T005 [US1] Implement the public `MazeService.destroy` function for maze cleanup in `src/ServerScriptService/Services/MazeService.lua`

## 4. Phase 3: Testing & Polish

This phase focuses on ensuring the implementation meets all success criteria defined in the specification.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T006 Manually test maze generation for all difficulties ("Small", "Medium", "Large") to verify correct dimensions and solvability.
- [x] T007 Perform a code review of `MazeService.lua` to ensure adherence to the constitution and coding standards.

## 5. Dependencies

- **[US1]** is self-contained and has no dependencies on other user stories.

## 6. Parallel Execution

- Within **[US1]**, tasks are sequential and should be completed in order (T001 → T005). No parallel opportunities exist.

## 7. Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a single-pass approach, completing all tasks for the maze generation feature. The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the completion of all tasks outlined in this document, resulting in a fully functional maze generation system as per the specification.
